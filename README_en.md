# Participatory Urban Janitorial - Citizen iOS Application

## Introduction

It is known that information handling is crucial for an efficient management and that is why Participatory Urban Janitorial(or ZUP) features a full life historic of each of the assets and of municipal problems, incorporating citizens' requests, geo-referenced data, technical reports, photographs and preventive actions taken over time. This way, the system centralizes all the information, allowing authorities and field technicians to take rapid decisions.

This component is responsible by connecting the user to the institute using ZUP for management.
